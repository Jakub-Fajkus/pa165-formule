## REST API
The API Swagger2 documentation is available [here](http://localhost:8080/pa165/swagger-ui/index.html) (when the server is running). 
There you can also test our API. Not all methods from facade have their own API. In API are only methods 
which are required for front-end in javascript as we decided that the rest of them are not useful.

### Test our apps
For testing our application run this command from the root folder *mvn clean install && cd formula1-rest && mvn cargo:run*.
